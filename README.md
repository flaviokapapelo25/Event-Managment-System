## Overview

The **Event Management System** allows users to easily create, manage, and book events. Whether you're an organizer looking to set up an event or a user wanting to book a spot, this application provides the tools you need. The use of ASP.NET Core ensures high performance and scalability, while the 3-tier architecture keeps the code organized and maintainable.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user login and registration using ASP.NET Identity.

## Architecture

The system follows a **3-tier architecture**:

1. **Presentation Layer**: The user interface built with ASP.NET MVC and Razor Pages.
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Contains the core application logic and handles data processing.
3. **Data Access Layer**: Interacts with the database using Entity Framework Core and LINQ.

This structure enhances maintainability and scalability, allowing for easier updates and modifications.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core 8.0**: The framework for building the web application.
- **Entity Framework Core**: An ORM for database operations.
- **MailKit**: For sending email notifications.
- **SQL Server**: The database management system.
- **Dependency Injection**: To manage dependencies throughout the application.
- **Repository Pattern**: For abstracting data access logic.
- **LINQ**: For querying data in a more readable format.
- **ASP.NET Identity**: For user authentication and authorization.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: To manage user permissions effectively.
